# Jewellery Try-On
It is a simple openCV based python script for virtual try-on experience. It allows users to see how a jewellery looks on themselves by opening up a camera. The script allows size as an input, opening a lot of room for customization. However, this script is simple and only sticks to one static size. By default, the jewellery is shown in the middle of the frame, which can be changed by bringing calculated changes to the roi (Region of Interest) variable.
